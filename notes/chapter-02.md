# Chapter 2

If you have a sequence of samples, you don't have to play them in order. Instead, you can use another input signal as indexes into that sequence of samples. If the sample signal is x and the input signal is y, the new signal is `z[n] = x[y[n]]`.

## Duty cycle

The relative amount of time the waveform fills the cycle.

Squeezing the waveform by a factor of 2 has the effect of stretching the Fourier series by two.!
